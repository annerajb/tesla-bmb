There are several calls to a routine that uses 32-bit subtraction with Borrow, SUBB.  The purpose is to compare timer
values and set/clear the Carry(Borrow) Flag as an indication of greater than or less than, and also
return with the result of the calculation in R7.

The routine is at x0130 and gets called from x0702 and x0BA2:

x0702 enters with Carry set and deals with reading and storing data (@R1 location) from the UART call in x06D2, 

x0BA2 has 2 callers, which enter with C=1 in x0B53 or C=0 in x0935
    x0935 is related to Timer2 OverFlow and sets timer value to [FF,FF,FF,FF]
    X0B53 deals with [X37-3A] in x06EE, or [0,0,(X08),(X09)] in x0918
    
So this generic math routine is used to evaluate different timer values used for various purposes, e.g. UART, SPI, W/D
